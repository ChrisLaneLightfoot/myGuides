Tricycle External Developer Billing Process (and some other stuff)
==
### Before your first project or task
Before you begin working with Tricycle you will first need to fill out and submit a Contractors Agreement and W9 to be approved and entered into our vendor system (note that this is a "by invitation only" party).
### Getting going on a task
Once you are registered with our system you will work with a Project Manger (PM) or Project Dev Lead to understand the task or project that we are are interested in having you work on.
### Estimates (ya gotta make em)
Once you understand the task that we are asking you to work on you must submit an estimate (with timeframe to complete the work) to your Tricycle contact (the Trike PM or Project Dev Lead) and the estimate must be approved by the PM.  Billable work cannot begin until there is an estimate in place (even if the estimate is for the time required to research the problem enough to provide a reasonable estimate).   Estimates will either be in hours or a fixed bid for the project depending on; the type of work, size of project, the agreement with the PM.  
### When you are really going
When you are fully integrated in our team you will often receive an email from one of our Project Dev Leads after Tuesday Sprint Planning with a list of tasks that we hope you will accomplish in the subsequent sprint.
### Rubber... road and phoning home
Once your estimate (and timeframe) is approved you can start to work with your Project Dev Lead and move the project forward.  We expect enough communication from you to allow our team to feel comfortable that you are moving forward and can complete your task(s) on time and in budget.  Most communication will happen either in IM (#slack is our preferred IM tool), GitHub, ScreenHero (or other co-programming tool), web conference, email, or lastly phone.
### You have to test!!
We expect you to test and QA your work (on the iPad if you are working on presentation content) and we expect that any pull requests that you submit will follow our Github branching strategy guidelines and will be fully ready for final QA.  Developers that routinely submit work that is rejected by our QA will be removed from our team.
### Getting paid
After you complete your task (or on a schedule agreed upon with the PM) you can submit an invoice for the work.

Invoices should be submitted to vendorinvoices@tricyclestudios.com.

All invoices must contain the Tricycle job number of the task you worked on (this is supplied by the PM or Project Dev Lead).  If you are working on multiple projects with different Tricycle job numbers please provide a separate line item on your invoice for each job.

Additionally, each line item should have a comment indicating the work done and the percent complete to allow the PM to properly track your work and progress.

All invoices are paid net 30.


### Trust and Respect* 
Building trust and respect in a remote setup is more difficult than in a co-located context because the communication channels are of a lower quality (audio/video/text vs. face-to-face conversation).
While trust and respect is re-enforced by extensive use of IM, email, web conference tools etc. we find the  basics of team respect come from the abilities of the remote team members themselves (both in communication skills and technical skills). All team members are responsible for their own level of respect in the team, and any member that is not earning the respect of the team needs to be evaluated and removed if they are not able to “pull it together”.
What we do is a craft and craftspeople like to work with other craftspeople that are good...

### Communication
We believe a well performing team has excellent communication skills. With effective communication you create opportunities for learning from others. You can find out almost in real-time if the information is or isn’t available within the team. That way you can make informed decisions.
Asynchronous communications channels are best, such as a persistent group chat. This can also improve information transfer within the team. The communicated facts are persisted and searchable at a later time. It also does not interrupt others.
Commitment
Making and keeping commitments is just as important in a remote context. Without keeping commitments, the team loses trust, fails to reach it’s goals and will lose focus.
In a remote context it is more difficult to have the same visibility within the team, because you can’t see what others are doing. That’s why each team member needs to be self-driven and responsible. They should not wait to be told what to do, and they should take initiative when needed. To improve the visibility, remote pair programming can help.
### Courage
To improve yourself and the quality of your work you need courage to make the changes needed. In a remote context it’s sometimes difficult to visualise some problems. Another issue is that some changes are more difficult to make, such as changing something in a remote location. To counter this, the team needs to be empowered to make the changes it needs.
### Feedback
Feedback enables that almost real-time information exchanged mentioned in the communication section. In essence, it covers the communication gaps that can lead to waste and erosion of trust. In a remote context, it may be difficult to receive feedback from clients, or from other team members.
To counter these issues, it’s important to be transparent about problems.  Instant audio/video conference should be possible between any two team members. All team members need to have access to all tools, versioning system, documents, from any location they may be working at.
